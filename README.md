# acc-query-rec-prototype

## Prototype 

You can find the prototype I drew out either in slack channel #acc-query-rec or our [project folder titled "Goals & Features & Prototype.pdf".](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CMR0Xy9SCVJWOaz0WQ3Iwq-h4reKuRb1)

I created a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A5L7aOEzU7iMtNzmz5nYw6S9Tqn70izcrfP7t_s0Vgw/edit) to document our progress in one place; but you may also choose to send any updates in slack through our small group channel.

## Replit

You can edit your files in replit.com. It's an online IDE that allows you to write code and host our website in one place (click run and you will see rendered website instantly). It has shell integrated so you can do the terminal commands just like in your local. There are other alternatives. VS Code is a good option as well. You can switch between IDEs as you like. 

If you want to use replit:

Go to https://replit.com/~, sign up or log in. \
Go to ```My Repls```, (optional: create a new folder) and then click top right corner + icon to create a ```New Repl```. Choose your ```Template``` to be ```HTML, CSS, JS```, name your replit. \
Once you are in, go ahead and follow the steps in *Branching* section: "Once you're in replit,..."

Here is the tutorial: https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/git-with-replit

**Important**: 

one downside of replit is if you close (or refresh) your tab, it may ask you to reenter your email and name like this

```
git config --global user.name "Jane Doe"
git config --global user.email "jane@example.com"
```

It is bothering so if you do use replit, better leave the page opened there and complete any edits in one sitting. 

another thing is that every time you pull from origin or push your commits it will ask for your GitHub name and password (PAT), to stop it, you can follow the tutorial: [pushing-without-typing-in-your-password-or-access-token](https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/git-with-replit#pushing-without-typing-in-your-password-or-access-token).

## Branching

Once you're in replit, you open ```Shell```, and I believe you will see ```~/acc-query-rec-prototype$```, you can do

```git clone https://github.com/Yumian-Cui/acc-query-rec-prototype.git``` \
```cd acc-query-rec-prototype``` \
```git checkout -b <name you like>``` (```-b``` auto switch to that branch after creating it)

After adding and commting with comments, you push to your own branch

```git push -u origin <your branch>```

**if you don't like replit**, I believe you can do the same steps in your local as above.
