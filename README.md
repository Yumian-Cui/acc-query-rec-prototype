## Replit

You can edit your files in replit.com. It's an online IDE that allows you to write code and host your program in one place. It has shell integrated so you can do the terminal commands just like in your local.

## Branching

Once you're in replit, you open ```Shell```, and I believe you will see ```~/acc-query-rec-prototype$```, you can then create your branch

  ```git checkout -b <name you like>``` (```-b``` auto switch to that branch after creating it) \
do any edits, add, commit, and then\
```git push -u origin <your branch>```

if you don't like replit, ignore above and in your local you can do 

```git clone https://github.com/Yumian-Cui/acc-query-rec-prototype.git``` \
```cd acc-query-rec-prototype``` \
```git checkout -b <name you like>``` 

After adding and commting with comments, you push to your own branch

```git push -u origin <your branch>```
